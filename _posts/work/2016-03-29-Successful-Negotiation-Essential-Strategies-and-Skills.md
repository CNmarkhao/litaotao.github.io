## 1. Introduction and Overview

We all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement. Through this course, you’ll learn the strategies and skills that can lead to successful negotiations in your personal life and in business transactions.

## 2. Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy


This module focuses on the first step in the negotiation process—planning for a negotiation. After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Decide if a negotiation is position-based or interest-based
- Decide if a negotiation is dispute-resolution or deal-making
- Complete a negotiation analysis, including: setting a reservation price and stretch goal, identifying alternatives to a deal, and finding the zone of potential agreement
- Use a decision tree to determine your BATNA
- Conduct cross-cultural negotiations
- Resolve ethical issues in negotiations
- Decide if you should use an agent in a negotiation

### 2.1 Assessing Your Negotiating Style

To assess your negotiation style while preparing for negotiations, complete the following three steps:

- Complete the attachment to assess and understand your negotiating style.

- Use the assessment to assess the style of the other side. This is especially important in cross-cultural negotiations. Remember that there can be considerable variation in negotiation style within a culture.

- Do a gap analysis. Locate the major gaps between your style and the style of the other side. Focus on these gaps when preparing for the negotiation.

Additional tip: After completing the gap analysis, try a role reversal exercise where you use the style of the other side. This will enable you to better understand the other side’s style.

Assessing Your Negotiating Style

Instructions: Listed below are ten important traits of a person’s negotiating style and approach. Each trait demonstrates a wide range of variations, which can be organized along a continuum, as has been done below. With respect to each trait, indicate

with an X where your own negotiating style and approach in business negotiation falls along each continuum.

- Goal: What is your goal in business negotiations: a binding contract or the creation of a relationship?
